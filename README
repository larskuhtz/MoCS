== OVERVIEW ==

MoCS -- Monitor Circuits Synthesis for PSL specifications

MoCS synthesies monitor circuits from linear time temporal logic
specifications. The input logic is similar to PSL by allowing nesting of
regular expressions within temporal modalities. The output of MoCS is a
synthesizable VHDL description of the monitor circuit. The resulting monitors
implement truncated path semantics. On sequentially reading an input trace a
monitor outputs at each input position whether the current prefix of the trace
satisfies the monitored property. MoCS is particularly careful about generating
small monitors form specifications containing sub-properties of bounded
temporal scope.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Please note that MoCS is still prototypic phase. Not all operators are
supported in all contexts yet. This is not due to limitations of the approach
but to missing bits in the implementation. If you rely on such a missing bit
please let us know. Simliar statement holds for the technical quality of the
generated VHDL Model.
